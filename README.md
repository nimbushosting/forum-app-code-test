# Forum App Code Test
An application designed to test applicant coding abilities

### Basics
You should follow these steps
- Create a Laravel application that will act as a forum for users
- Guest users should be able to see all threads
- Only logged in users can start a thread or leave a comment on a thread
- Comments should be able to be upvoted (by logged in users) but should show the number of votes to all
- Users should be able to register, login, logout
- Threads should be able to be filtered by category

### Extra credit
- Write some feature tests covering the end-to-end user journey
- Write some unti tests covering specific methods
- Create some Vue components to put in the blade files (Vue router, VueX not neccessary)
- Use TailwindCSS to style your pages

Once completed, please provide the link (or invite Nimbus Hosting) for for review

Good Luck.
